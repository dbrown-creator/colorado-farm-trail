"""Map filter groups: how the many Category labels in the data roll up into chips.

The data keeps precise labels ("Meat Producer & Packer", "Bakery", "Community Food
Hub" ...) because they're accurate and searchable. The map shows a short list of
groups instead; a listing appears under every group any of its labels belongs to.
Some labels are attributes rather than places to go and render as badges.

Reviewed with the maintainer 2026-10-03 (cutover step 2 uses this table).
