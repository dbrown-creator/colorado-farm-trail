"""Source: USDA Local Food Portal — ALL FIVE local-food directories.

The portal hosts five directories, each with the same two access paths:

  farmersmarket · onfarmmarket · csa · foodhub · agritourism

  * data_share (NO key)  -> /mywp/wp-json/frontend/data_share?directory=<dir>&state=co
    Only returns listings that opted into data-sharing, with a thin field set
    (name/contact/address/website — no coords). CO counts as of 2026-07:
    farmersmarket ≈6, onfarmmarket 37, csa 41, foodhub 12, agritourism 12.

  * api (KEY required)   -> /api/<dir>/?apikey=KEY&... with location params:
    state=co (documented; tried first — one request per directory) or
    x=LON&y=LAT&radius=MILES (grid-sweep fallback across Colorado).
    Rich field set: coords, socials, description, plus listing_id + updatetime
    (captured for the update engine — see docs/UPDATE_ENGINE.md).

`parse_api` field names are verified against a live keyed farmersmarket sample
(scripts/tests/fixtures/usda_api_sample.json); records carry a `directory_type`
discriminator, so the same parser serves all five directories. Spot-checked live
on 2026-10-03: all five share the base field set, except agritourism has no
`location_street` (street is parsed from the one-line `location_address`), and
csa/foodhub carry season + a source-truncated product list in `mydesc`.
