"""Deduplicate + merge markets across sources into one row per real market.

Priority: sources are folded in the order given (put the most trustworthy first —
Colorado Proud, then USDA, then CFMA, then curated). The first source to fill a
field wins; later sources only fill gaps. Provenance is preserved per field.

Dedup key: normalized-name + city. A light second pass also merges two groups whose
coordinates sit within ~200 m of each other (catches name spelling drift), so long
as they are in the same city AND share a distinctive name word - dense directories
(the Colorado Proud member finder) put unrelated businesses on the same block.
