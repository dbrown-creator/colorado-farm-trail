"""Normalized schema for the Colorado farmers-market scrape.

Every source is mapped into a `Market` record whose public columns are exactly the
23 My Maps columns that the Colorado Proud / Farm Fresh pipeline emits
(see scripts/fetch_farm_data.py and DATA.md). This lets the output import into the
same Google My Maps setup with no changes.

Confidence rule: a field is only ever populated when a source *states it explicitly*.
Nothing is inferred or guessed. Every populated field records which source it came
from in `.provenance`, so conflicts and coverage can be audited later.
